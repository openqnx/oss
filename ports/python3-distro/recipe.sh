# distro: OS distribution information (os-release, lsb_release); on QNX it
# reports what /etc/os-release says, or nothing. Needed by rospkg.
# Pure Python: the published wheel is platform independent, so it is
# installed as released (see scripts/lib/pywheel.sh).
# Its console scripts are written as launchers in bin/ (qnx_py_scripts).
VERSION=1.9.0
