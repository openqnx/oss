# python3-six 1.17.0

**🟡 Runtime-standalone** — Needs other components **to build** (listed below), but what it installs runs on the target **on its own**.

## Install the prebuilt package on a target

No build needed: [`oss-get`](../../target/oss-get) downloads the package (and its run-time dependencies), checks its SHA-256 and unpacks it.

```sh
# on the QNX target
oss-get update
oss-get install python3-six
oss-get install python3-six-dev    # only for building on the target: headers, .pc, CMake files
```

See [docs/packages.md](../../docs/packages.md) for setting up `oss-get` on a board.

## Build it from upstream

Every step below can be run by hand. `./scripts/qnxbuild python3-six` performs exactly the same steps (2–5) in one command.

### 1. Build environment

A Linux host with QNX SDP 8.0 installed and licensed — or the container in [`docker/`](../../docs/build-environment.md), which needs only the SDP mounted. Then, from the repository root:

```bash
export QNX_SDP_ROOT=$HOME/qnx800      # your SDP 8.0 installation
./scripts/build-host-tools.sh          # once per machine
source ./env.sh aarch64le              # or x86_64; once per shell
```

`env.sh` sets up the cross compiler (`qcc`/`q++`), the staging tree `stage/<arch>/usr/local` (= `/usr/local` on the target), pkg-config, and the CMake/Meson toolchain files.

**Build the dependencies first** (15 component(s)), or let `qnxbuild` do it:

```bash
./scripts/qnxbuild python3
```

### 2. Get the upstream source

```bash
URL=https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/b7/ce/149a00dd41f10bc29e5921b496af8b574d8413afcd5e30dfa0ed46c2cc5e/six-1.17.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
mkdir -p dist src/python3-six
curl -fL -o dist/$(basename $URL) $URL
echo "4721f391ed90541fddacab5acf947aa0d3dc7d27b2e1e8eda2be8970586c3274  dist/$(basename $URL)" | sha256sum -c -
tar xf dist/$(basename $URL) -C src/python3-six --strip-components=1
```

### 3. Apply the QNX patches

None — the upstream source builds for QNX unmodified; everything QNX-specific is in the configuration below and in the shared toolchain files.

### 4. Configure, build and install into the staging tree

This component uses its own build steps (`do_build`, `do_install`), run with `S` = the source tree, `B` = the build directory:

```bash
S=src/python3-six; B=build/$QNX_ARCH/python3-six; mkdir -p $B
```

```bash
do_build() { :; }
```

```bash
do_install() { qnx_py_install_pure; }
```

Why the configuration looks like this (from [`recipe.sh`](recipe.sh)):

- six: Python 2/3 compatibility (run-time dependency of python-dateutil). Pure Python: the published wheel is platform independent, so it is installed as released (see scripts/lib/pywheel.sh).

Or all of steps 2–4 at once: `./scripts/qnxbuild -a $QNX_ARCH python3-six`.

### 5. What it installs

6 files under `/usr/local`.

The complete list is `stage/<arch>/.manifest/python3-six` after a build.

### 6. Package it for the target

```bash
./scripts/qnxpkg -a $QNX_ARCH python3-six
ls repo/8.0/*/ | grep '^python3-six-'
```

This writes `python3-six-<ver>-r0.tar.gz` (run time) and `python3-six-dev-<ver>-r0.tar.gz` (headers, pkg-config, CMake files, static libraries), the matching `.apk` files, and updates the repository index. The run-time dependencies recorded in the package are computed from the binaries.

## Run it on a target

Either install from your own repository (serve `repo/8.0/` with any web server):

```sh
# on the target
export OSS_REPO=http://<build-host>:8000
oss-get update && oss-get install python3-six
```

or copy the tarball and unpack it yourself:

```bash
scp repo/8.0/aarch64/python3-six-*-r0.tar.gz root@<target>:/data/
ssh root@<target> 'cd /data/oss && tar xzf /data/python3-six-*-r0.tar.gz'
```

QNX has no `ld.so.conf`; make the libraries findable with `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib` (with `oss-get link`) or `eval $(oss-get env)`.
